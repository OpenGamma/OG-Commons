Strata
======

Our development has transitioned to Strata - OpenGamma's next generation, open source toolkit for market risk.
The code in the `strata-collect` and `strata-basics` modules is a direct descendent of this code.

Strata is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/OpenGamma/Strata](https://github.com/OpenGamma/Strata). Pease see the [Strata Documentation](http://opengamma.github.io/StrataDocs) for full details.
